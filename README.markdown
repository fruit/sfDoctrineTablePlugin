# sfDoctrineTablePlugin

The ``sfDoctrineTablePlugin`` generates feature packed base tables to each model.
Base table contains PHPDocs of available pre-generated ``WHERE``, ``COUNT``
and ``JOIN`` considering table relations and its depth. List of new available
methods are accessed through the PHPDoc tag @method and are suitable for IDE
users only (prefect implementation in [NetBeans 7.1](http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html "NetBeans Download page"))

# 1. <a id="desc">Description</a>

Plugin helps you not to remember tables relation aliases and escape from the constructing left and/or inner joins.
It gives you ability to use pre-generated methods with IDE code-completion
to speed-up your coding. Also, you could add your owns methods to the generator's
template by extending it.

# 3. <a id="install">Installation</a>

 * As symfony plugin

  * Installing

            ./symfony plugin:install sfDoctrineTablePlugin

  * Upgrading

            cd plugins/sfDoctrineTablePlugin
            git pull origin master
            cd ../..

 * As GIT submodule (in general for plugin-developers - contains test suit)

  * Installation

            $ git submodule add git://github.com/fruit/sfDoctrineTablePlugin.git plugins/sfDoctrineTablePlugin
            $ git submodule init plugins/sfDoctrineTablePlugin

  * Upgrading

            $ cd plugins/sfDoctrineTablePlugin
            $ git pull origin master
            $ cd ../..

# 4. <a id="uninstall">Uninstallation</a>

  Unusual uninstallation process! First of all you should rollback your base table
  class inheritance and remove generated base table classes for models. All that
  you can make by executing:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table --uninstall

  In case, you have your own ``Doctrine_Table`` class
  (e.g. ``Doctrine_Table_Advanced``), you need to replace inherited
  class ``Doctrine_Table_Scoped`` with ``Doctrine_Table_Advanced``.

  Then usual uninstallation process:

    ./symfony plugin:uninstall sfDoctrineTablePlugin

  Then, build your models, to be sure, all is O.K.

    ./symfony doctrine:build-model

# 5. <a id="setup">Setup</a>

## 5.1. <a id="h5_1">Check plugin is enabled</a>

    [php]
    <?php

    class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
    {
      public function setup ()
      {
        // â€¦ other plugins
        $this->enablePlugins('sfDoctrineTablePlugin');
      }
    }

## 5.2. <a id="h5_2">Configure</a>

### 5.2.1 <a id="h5_2_1">Plugin</a>

    all:
      sf_doctrine_table_plugin:

        # Extended by plugin class Doctrine_Table
        # (default: Doctrine_Table_Scoped)
        custom_table_class:   Doctrine_Table_Scoped

  Use case: You have extended by yourself class ``Doctrine_Table`` and name it
  ``Doctrine_Table_Advanced``, thus plugin configuration should looks like:

    all:
      sf_doctrine_table_plugin:
        custom_table_class: Doctrine_Table_Advanced

  Also, class ``Doctrine_Table_Advanced`` should be extended from
  ``Doctrine_Table_Scoped`` - that's all

    [php]
    <?php

    class Doctrine_Table_Advanced extends Doctrine_Table_Scoped
    {
      // ...
    }

### 5.2.1 <a id="h5_2_2">Model</a>

  By default base tables will be generated to all models and to all enabled
  plugins that contains schema files. Occasionally, you won't use
  all models to query its data, some of them will be used to save data. In
  such cases is reasonable to disable the base tables generation. How to do that
  please refer to <a href="#h5_4">5.4. Turning off base table generation for
  specific models</a>.

  According to my own experience, the most profit you will get in case you disable
  automatic relation detection (``detect_relations: false``) and setup only important
  to you relations by hand. Advantages to the solutions are clear generated method
  names and small file size (APC will be thankful to you).

  Here is small ``schema.yml`` example:

    detect_relations: false

    Country:
      columns:
        id: { type: integer(4), primary: true, autoincrement: true }
        capital_city_id: { type: integer(4) }
        title: string(255)
      relations:
        Capital:
          class: City
          local: capital_city_id
          foreign: id
          type: one
          foreignType: one
          foreignAlias: CapitalOfTheCountry

    City:
      columns:
        id: { type: integer(4), primary: true, autoincrement: true }
        country_id: { type: integer(4) }
        title: string(255)
      relations:
        Country:
          foreignAlias: Cities


  After base table are generated, you can see following methods beside other methods:

    $q = CityTable::getInstance()->createQuery('ci');
    CityTable::getInstance()
      ->withInnerJoinOnCountry($q)
      ->withLeftJoinOnCapitalViaCountry($q)
      ->withLeftJoinOnCapitalOfTheCountryViaCountryAndCapital($q);

  The generated SQL (``$q->getSqlQuery()``) will looks like:

    SELECT
      c.id AS c__id, c.country_id AS c__country_id, c.title AS c__title,
      c2.id AS c2__id, c2.capital_city_id AS c2__capital_city_id, c2.title AS c2__title,
      c3.id AS c3__id, c3.country_id AS c3__country_id, c3.title AS c3__title,
      c4.id AS c4__id, c4.capital_city_id AS c4__capital_city_id, c4.title AS c4__title
    FROM city c
      INNER JOIN country c2 ON c.country_id = c2.id
      LEFT JOIN city c3 ON c2.capital_city_id = c3.id
      LEFT JOIN country c4 ON c3.id = c4.capital_city_id

  And here is DQL (``$q->getDql()``) will looks like:

     FROM City ci
      INNER JOIN ci.Country c
      LEFT JOIN c.Capital c_c
      LEFT JOIN c_c.CapitalOfTheCountry c_c_cotc


## 5.3. <a id="h5_3">Execute task</a>

### 5.3.1 <a id="h5_3_1">Usage</a>

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table [--application[="..."]] [--env="..."] [--depth[="..."]] [--minified] [--uninstall] [--generator-class="..."] [--no-confirmation] [name1] ... [nameN]

  For full task details, please refer to the task help block:

    ./symfony help doctrine:build-table

### 5.3.2 <a id="h5_3_2">Build base tables</a>

  Run this task each time you update the schema.yml and rebuild models:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table

### 5.3.3 <a id="h5_3_3">Customize JOIN's deepness</a>

  By default JOINs deepness is 3 (superfluously enough), but you can adjust it
  by passing flag ``--depth``:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table --depth=4

### 5.3.4 <a id="h5_3_4">Optimize tables for production</a>

  When you deploy your code to production you need to minimize generated base
  table class file size by passing flag ``--minified`` (e.i. base tables without
  @method hints):

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table --env=prod --minified

  **Remember** to enable APC and be sure, cache is working right!

    # Check for ``apc.num_files_hint`` is greater than yours project's PHP file count:
    find ./ -type f -name "*.php" | wc -l

    # Check for ``apc.max_file_size`` is greater than your project's worst PHP file:
    find ./ -type f -name "*.php" -size +1M

    # Check for ``apc.shm_size`` is greater than all PHP files size:
    find ./ -type f -name "*.php" -ls | awk '{total += $7} END {print total}'

## 5.4. <a id="h5_4">Turning off base table generation for specific models</a>

  By default task ``doctrine:build-model`` will generate base tables for each
  existing model, unless you disable it. To disable it you need to add option
  ``table: false`` to the specific model schema.yml:

    Book:
      options:
        symfony: { table: false }

  Then rebuild models:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-model

  And generate updated base tables:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table

  There are some nuances to know. When you disable model(-s), which base table(-s) was generated before,
  task ``doctrine:build-table`` will uninstall disabled base table automatically.

## 5.5. <a id="h5_5">Base tables generation for a specific models</a>

  Now you can pass manually a list of models you would like to generate base tables
  (NOTE: table generation should not be turned off - see
  <a href="#h5_4">Turning off base table generation for specific models</a> for
  more information)

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table City Country

  The same principle to uninstall a specific models:

    ./symfony doctrine:build-table --uninstall City Country

# 6. <a id="how">How it works</a>

  All is very tricky. Each available method for code-completion does not contains code at all.
  That is - no extra code, smallest file size. Things are done by implementing ``PHPDoc`` directive @method.

  Here is code sample of generated base table for model City - file ``BaseCityTable.class.php``
  preview on [http://pastie.org/private/qhlsjqlxxzohe0r0jfpew](http://pastie.org/private/qhlsjqlxxzohe0r0jfpew "Preview")

  As you could observe, additionally PHPDoc contains ``@c`` directives:

    * ...
    * @c(m=withLeftJoinOnSection,o=s,f=^,ra=Section,c=buildLeft)
    * @c(m=withInnerJoinOnSection,o=s,f=^,ra=Section,c=buildInner)
    * ...
    * @c(m=withLeftJoinOnPostMediaImageViaImagesAndTranslations,o=is_ts_pmi,f=is_ts,ra=PostMediaImage,c=buildLeft)
    * @c(m=withInnerJoinOnPostMediaImageViaImagesAndTranslations,o=is_ts_pmi,f=is_ts,ra=PostMediaImage,c=buildInner)
    * ...

  This information helps to build requested method on the fly by implementing magic method ``__call``.
  This works pretty fast even base table class size is about 300kb.

# 7. <a id="problem">Known problem</a>

  Joined table aliases may change when existing relation is removed or new relations are added
before existing one.
  This happens due to aliases are generated based on component name.

  For example model owns 2 relations Company and Category:

    [yaml]
    Article:
      relations:
        Company:
          class: Company
          local: article_id
        Category:
          class: Category
          local: category_id

  Assume we need to join both tables Company and Category from the table Article.

    [php]

    $q = ArticeTable::getInstance()->createQuery('a');
    ArticeTable::getInstance()
      ->withInnerJoinOnCompany($q)
      ->withInnerJoinOnCategory($q)
    ;

    $q->select('a.*, c.title, ca.slug')->execute();

  All relations starts with "C", this mean that joined Company table maps to "c"
  and Category maps to the "ca" (due to "c" is used).

  You have made a database refactoring and relation "Company" was removed.
  Next step is to fix the query given above by removing all things related to a "Company":

    [php]

    $q = ArticeTable::getInstance()->createQuery('a');
    ArticeTable::getInstance()
      ->withInnerJoinOnCategory($q)
    ;

    $q->select('a.*, ca.slug')->execute();

  Code will be still erroneous, because the new generated alias for table Category maps to the letter "c".
  So, to fix code sample, you need to replace "ca.slug" with "c.slug".

    [php]

    $q->select('a.*, c.slug')->execute();

  If anybody could help me to elegantly solve this issue - I will be pleasantly thankful.

# 8. <a id="bench">Benchmarks</a>

  Given below statistical numbers are generated for production environment
  with ``--minified`` flag and enabled APC:

  Here is time cost to initialize new table instance (e.g. ``Doctrine::getTable('MyTable')``)
  with generated base table and without.
  As you could notice, this it pretty large table with 26 relations and 19 columns.
  It demonstrates that even big table load time is slower than 0.00142 s. comparing
  to a default initialization time.

  All the more so it's just first time you initialize any table, all following
  table initializations will be comparatively slower than 0.0001 s.

    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |              Time required to initialize table instance              |
    +----------+--------+--------+---------------+-------------+-----------+
    | Relation | Column | Depth  |    Default    | With plugin | Slower on |
    |   count  |  count | level  |      (s)      |     (s)     |    (s)    |
    +----------+--------+--------+---------------+-------------+-----------+
    |    26    |   19   |   3    |       0.01411 |     0.01553 |   0.00142 |
    +----------+--------+--------+---------------+-------------+-----------+

  Given below table demonstrates how many time is spent to analyze PHPDoc.
  Referencing to table data, generated base table will add additionally ~ 0.0003 s.
  to each magic method call.

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |          Time required to add new Doctrine Query parts                  |
    +----------------------+------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+
    |        Method        |   Method   |  Default  | With plugin | Slower on |
    |         name         | complexity |    (s)    |     (s)     |    (s)    |
    +----------------------+------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+
    |      orWhereId       |    low     |   0.00003 |     0.00035 |   0.00032 |
    +----------------------+------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+
    | withLeftJoinOnGroups |    high    |   0.00410 |     0.00435 |   0.00025 |
    +----------------------+------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+

  Things to remember:

  * Minified classes uses less space on disk, but does not affects the table initialization time.
  * Depth level with enabled APC does not affects the table initialization time (difference less than 0.001 s.).
  * The more generation depth, table relations and columns count, the more file size.
